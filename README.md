# Risk Analysis of Breast Tumor Cells
## This project aims to implement and compare four different classification algorithms, namely SVM, K-nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes on data regarding breast tumor cells that are classified as either benign or malignant, with the goal of finding an applicable algorithm to predict unlabeled tumor cells as a diagnosis method. The classification models are tuned after the exploration of their optimal features.
The roadmap includes data exploration and visualization, data preprocessing, and the implementation of the algorithms.
